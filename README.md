Lumbar spine degenerative disease, also known as degenerative disc disease, is a condition characterized by the progressive deterioration of the discs between the vertebrae in the lower back. 
This condition is often a natural part of aging and can lead to symptoms such as back pain, stiffness, and in some cases, nerve pain due to herniated discs.

Lumbar Spine Degenerative classification used a customized model that is combination of DenseNet and CNN used dataset from the roboflow (link is provided), for downloading the dataset to model used the TFRecord format.
for this model the accuracy - 95.67% and the validation recall - 97.38%
for testing this model on new images, it shows weather the spine is degenerative spine or normal spine
